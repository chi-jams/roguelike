# Design V1

The first iteration of this program will be a simple top-down shooter where a
player can navigate around a map and shoot at enemies. The player may eiter use
a mouse and a keyboard or a gamepad in order to be able to navigate around. At
this point in time, the game will be a simple multiplayer game where one player
will use a gamepad and the other will use a mouse and keyboard. 

The intent of this first version is to get simple graphics rendering on screen
and interacting with each other. While this may sound simple, writing these from
scratch is a non-trivial task. This version will be considered complete when the
following criteria are met:
- [ ] Objects are rendered to the screen with basic shading techniques
- [ ] User input enables the player to interact with the game.
- [ ] Objects in the world are able to interacti with each other through collisions.
